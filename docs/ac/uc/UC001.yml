  IC Command File Requirements:

  1. IC shall be fully driven by command files
  2. Command files shall be in YAML format
  3. Command files shall define commands with the following structure:

  ```yaml
  commands:
    <command_name>:
      help: <command description>
      shell: <shell command to execute>

  # Example:
  commands:
    init:
      help: Initializes a new git repository
      shell: git init

    status:
      help: Shows git repository status
      shell: git status
  ```

  4. Each command shall have:
     - A unique name under the 'commands' section
     - A help text describing the command's purpose
     - A shell command to be executed when invoked

  5. The command file structure shall be extensible for future additions
