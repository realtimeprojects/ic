  ## Acceptance Criteria

  1. Implementation of core command classes:
     - CommandFactory class with proper factory pattern
     - CommandBase abstract base class
     - ShellCommand concrete implementation

  2. API Documentation:
     - All classes shall have proper docstrings
     - All public methods shall be documented
     - Type hints shall be used throughout

  3. Dependencies:
     - setup.py shall be updated with any required external dependencies

  ## Implementation Requirements

  1. CommandFactory:
     - Shall provide a get(name: str, config: dict) method
     - Shall return appropriate Command instance based on configuration
     - Shall handle unknown command types gracefully

  2. CommandBase:
     - Shall be an abstract base class
     - Shall define run() method returning status code (0 = success)
     - Shall provide help() method returning command description

  3. ShellCommand:
     - Shall inherit from CommandBase
     - Shall implement shell command execution
     - Shall handle execution errors appropriately

  ## Technical Notes

  1. Command Type Detection:
     - shell: creates ShellCommand instance
     - script: reserved for future implementation (not implemented yet)

  2. Error Handling:
     - All commands shall return appropriate status codes
     - Execution errors shall be handled gracefully
     - Invalid configurations shall raise appropriate exceptions
