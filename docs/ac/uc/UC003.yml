  Command File Loading Requirements:

  1. During each invocation of `ic`, configuration files shall be loaded in the following sequence:

      a. Default configuration (installed with package)
      b. Project configuration (./.ic.yml)
      c. User global configuration (~/.config/ic/ic.yml)
      d. User home configuration (~/.ic.yml)

  2. File loading behavior:
     - Each file is optional except for the default configuration
     - Files are loaded only if they exist
     - Later files override or extend commands from earlier files
     - Command definitions in later files take precedence over earlier ones

  3. Configuration file locations:
     ```
     <package>/default.yml     # Default configuration (always loaded)
     ./.ic.yml                 # Project-specific configuration
     ~/.config/ic/ic.yml       # User global configuration
     ~/.ic.yml                 # User home configuration
     ```

  4. The loading sequence shall allow for:
     - System-wide default commands
     - Project-specific commands
     - User-specific customizations
     - Per-directory overrides
